# Awesome crates you should do

## For Rust beginners

You started learning Rust, went through a book or two, and some tutorials,
and now, what? What will you do with this knowledge? If you would like to start
working on a project of your own, but have no idea what would be useful or
interesting, start here!

You will find in the issues of this project a list of project ideas contributed
by other Rust developers, and mentors to help you get started.

Good luck!

## For experienced Rust developers

Do you have nice ideas for new Rust crates but cannot work on them (no time,
too many crates to maintain, etc)? Propose them here! A new Rust developer
might pick them up and realize them with your guidance.

To submit a crate idea, open an issue here, describing the project you would
like to see appear.

Thank you for your help!
