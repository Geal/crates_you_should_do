Welcome!

Thank you for sharing your crate idea and helping Rust beginners get their first real project.

Here are a few things to help them decide on your project:

# <cool crate name (or not, maybe they'll find one)>

## Description

<Short description of the project, what it should do, why it's useful (or not)>

## Why is it a nice idea?

<Provide some motivation for the person who will take on the project. Maybe there's a cool
technical challenge, maybe it has artistic value, maybe it's a small tool that will solve
a common problem...>

## Skills you'll learn

- <list of things the project will cover, like web development, or 3D, or using a specific crate>
- ...

## Mentor(s)

<If you're willing to mentor someone to do this project, write your github username here,
and add the label "has mentor" to the project. Otherwise, add the label "needs mentor">
